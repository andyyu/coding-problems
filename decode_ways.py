A message containing letters from A-Z is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:

'A' -> 1
'B' -> 2
...
'Z' -> 26

Given an encoded message containing digits, determine the total number of ways to decode it.

For example,
Given encoded message "12", it could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).

The number of ways decoding "12" is 2.

Difficulty: Medium-Hard

Solution notes:
Clearly a recurrence relation type problem. We can split the solution for a message of length n into two different outcomes.
If the last two characters in the string can be decoded separately (e.g. "...23" can be evaluated with "23" -> W or "2" -> B, "3" -> C),
then the number of ways that string can be decoded is num_decodings(n-1) + num_decodings(n-2).
The num_decodings(n-1) case is when we decode the last character separately, and the num_decodings(n-2) case is when we decode
the last two characters as a pair. Implementing this recurrence relation gives us this somewhat ugly code.

def num_decodings(s):
    if len(s) < 1 or s[0] == '0':
        return 0
    if len(s) == 1:
        if 27 > int(s) > 0:
            return len(s)
    elif len(s) > 1:
        if s[-1] == '0':
            if not (27 > int(s[-2:]) > 0):
                return 0
            else:
                if len(s) == 2:
                    return 1
                else:
                    return num_decodings(s[:-2])
        else:
            if 27 > int(s[-2:]) > 0 and s[-2] != '0':
                return max(1, num_decodings(s[:-2])) + num_decodings(s[:-1])
        return num_decodings(s[:-1])
    return 0

This works, but it's very slow. Why? Because there is a whole lot of duplicate computation going on. In our most common case,
we are returning num_decodings(s[:-2])) + num_decodings(s[:-1])). This could spawn up to 2^n separate computations! No good.

Thus, we turn to the wonder that is dynamic programming. We can cache the results we compute as we go, making the whole
process much faster.
