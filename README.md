# Coding Problems

Solutions (written in Python, by me) to a large, ongoing collection of coding problems.

From:
* [leetcode] (https://leetcode.com/)
* Cracking the Coding Interview (5th ed.)
* [Interview Cake] (https://www.interviewcake.com/)
 


<sub><sup> Solutions are always double checked, but may not always be the ideal solution. The space/time complexity is often the best possible, but there are often more creative and abstruse solutions that manage a bit more efficiency. </sup></sub>
